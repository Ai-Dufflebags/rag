looking at how Traders make 10 per month and we're going to stick with our theme Here using our case study on the Aussie dollar Now quickly obviously going through everything we've gone through in the previous two sessions we've identified the 75 12 level on a daily chart we've brought that down into a hourly chart we noticed that there was buy stops above us so we know that there's liquidity pools resting above very specific highs so the market should be reaching up there as much as 100 Pips from the level we're identifying 7512 so very easily get up to 76 12. um looking at the 15 minute time frame as we've shown earlier in this series we've shown that there was a buy set up at 7512 on the daily chart we had a old low everything that we referred to and what to focus on in September everything is being identified in this specific case study we don't really require the market to give us an hourly set up to get in and use that risk we can use a 15 minute time frame and used the the framework that price gives us on that specific time frame relative to what you see on a 15-minute time frame uh obviously the risk can be reduced from what would be seen on an hourly chart and then just as well the 15-minute chart can be reduced down into a five minute chart and we identified where the stock could be in relative terms to the bullish order block and we also framed out where three to one reward to risk ratios would unfold and it happened to be right below our first area of buy stops or the five minute liquidity pool now this is nowhere near the level of the objectives we identified just framing the trade on an hourly chart I'm just giving you the context what if we were to look at the market like this and say we traded this particular pair and we had a two percent risk on the trade foreign if we had two percent on the trade and the market trades up to this high where the buy stops are that's a liquidity pool the market should respond off of that 7512 level because the daily chart reference point or bullish order block if we take our two percent position and take half of that position off as we get three to one notice it doesn't have to even blow out the buy stops here these buy stops don't even have to get blown out this is three to one reward the risk so we can take first profit and Bank a one percent times three R so we can make three percent on this one trade here and still leave the second portion of the trade on aiming for what those liquidity pools referenced on the hourly chart now as price explodes and goes through those buy stops obviously you can see going up to a 15 minute time frame now we can go and look at higher liquidity pools reaching into higher and higher grade liquidity pools until we get to that hourly chart but for right now just simply look at what's already happened the framework we used for the five minute chart that we've outlined in the second session that model on risk allows us to have one two three four five six seven eight nine r in other words we made nine dollars for every one dollar risk just reaching into the 15-minute buy stop liquidity pool the liquidity pools that we saw in our chart that's what's being identified for our objectives but now here we have a we have a uh a Crossroads you know can we take some of the position off here or do we leave the second balance of the original position of two percent we only have one percent remaining on we could take a portion of that off or we can leave it to go higher and reach those higher objectives the choice is going to be yours preferably I think I would like to take something off because we're in a really nice liquidity pool relative to the 15 minute time frame and we might get some consolidation or could be wrong could even reverse here we don't ever know that but we are trading with higher level institutional overflow relative to that daily order block from 7512 we have seen expansion on the upside it's now taken by stops in the form of a liquidity pool in the five-minute chart we just shown then now we've see the 15-minute liquidity pool in the buy stops over here that's been violated so we've already seen nine to one payout which is astonishing by any measure and in letting the price go a little bit further once we clear this buy stop the area over here would be reached into as well and we'd have 15r as well now this is the liquidity pool that we're resting around that same hourly basis I'm just viewing it in terms of the 15 minute chart you can see the expansion is available to you when you look at the market framing it with very low risk very low risk now notice also we took first profit at a multiple of three to one so we made three dollars for our one dollar risk as soon as we did that we've already made three percent on the trade with ultra short-term risk less than 10 Pips that was it less than 10 Pips but let's just say we we framed the trade with a little bit more than that say we used a little bit more comfortable stop say it was a 20 pip stop could that still pay out in handsome Rewards why wouldn't it obviously the market reaches above the stops we know that the market reaches for 10 and 20 pip grades for stop sweeping we have the old high back here and price just gets real close to it but expands right above where we would expect to see price reach for here's what I want you to focus the potential range was about 100 Pips from where we were looking at buying and where we thought the price is going to go we don't need the absolute high and we don't need the absolute low we're looking at the lines portion of the move about nine about 100 Pips let me ask you a question do you think you'll get every pip of every potential range you identify as potential profit if you're insisting on it you're going to be frustrated but you don't need that what happens if you just had half of the range would you be disappointed if you say yes he would be disappointed my question is why would you be disappointed is that better than what you're doing now as a new Trader it's probably going to be very easy for you to say well that would be better than I'm I'm currently doing now let's look at some numbers assume for a minute we had a 1 000 trading account and we set the trade up originally as we did with the five minute chart less than 10 Pips we're going to say we rounded it to a 10 pip stop loss and the market came up and allowed us to get our three to one multiple in this trade we would already have three percent paid to us now we're going to assume that you've gone through the mentorship you've learned how to do this and you've gone to the point where you are comfortable trading with live funds or maybe you're still in the demo account if that choice is yours you have to make the decision in timing for your own sake I can't do that for you but say for instance you're looking at the trade and it's praying just like we were outlining it here and it allows you to get a two percent position on in other words the trade is two percent risk if you have the opportunity to get three to one paid out and you take that off your position now you have one percent remaining the first one percent taken off with a multiple of three to one you'd be taking profits at 30 Pips you've already banged three percent look what that does in a month by itself it's over 10 percent so even if that's all you get is the first profit objective of three to one so if you frame your trades with really small risk it's easy to get multiples of three to one or more for your reward so your R levels are easy to get to when you start refining your risk see it's not having big risk that makes the money it's having this small risk that makes the money that's the real secret the fact that you need to be able to frame your trades on levels that should see institutional sponsorship that means should the bank's Propel price higher or lower because it's off a daily chart or weekly chart on monthly chart those levels are going to be highly impactful in terms of price action they're going to drive price higher and lower relative to those levels because that's where the real orders are it has nothing to do with your indicators has nothing to do with your supply and demand or your theory on price has nothing to do with that it's where the orders are and the order is going to be around monthly weekly and daily levels now what if you let the portion of that second half go and you only got half of that 100 pit range remember we were looking at that setup it was potentially 100 Pips available to you but say you only let it go 50 Pips and you just couldn't bear to hold on to it that's all you could do or you did something that got you stopped out early okay you tried to stop up too aggressively and you only managed to make 50 Pips out of that now this is assuming you've already taken that first one percent off this is the second one percent that's remaining on the trade by itself if you collapse at 50 of the uh 100 range we were looking at you're tacking on another 21 plus percent for the month if that's all you're doing week after week if you're getting scenarios like this one trade you're focusing in tightly watching One setup and you're milking it for everything that it's worth keeping the risk small and looking for higher time frame objectives if you do that you're looking at 21 plus percent what it's going to cost 21 plus your original three percent on the first half of that trade so really what are you making and you didn't even get the entire 100 pit range now think about that we used the same scenario where we use the 10 pip stop and we let the second portion run after three to one was taken off at 30 Pips then we let the Marine portion run and say we only managed to get half that 100 pit range who would be upset would you be upset with that I don't think you should if you are it's greed you can't allow greed to do this to you now what happens if you get the entire 100 pip range say you get your 100 takedown another one shot one kill you get it for the entire week the second portion of that trade net you over 46 percent that's in one month okay if you let this continuously pain out and you do this every single week and you're looking for one shot one kill Seven Arrows and you get 100 pip objectives taken down on the second portion of your trade remember you're already taking partials off at three to one so you're taking one percent off if every trade you take is two percent once you know what you're doing you scale off one percent at three to one and you wait for the second portion to reach for these higher higher time frame objectives that's how you make a lot of money you pay yourself initially get paid pay the trader take partials don't listen to people that don't make money you have to pay yourself because you don't know if your trade's gonna pay now but once you get three to one you've already are you're already living in an environment that pays exceedingly well think about that if that's all you manage to do is get first objective at three to one it's all you ever did nothing ever panned out beyond that who would be complaining about that only folks that are demanding Precision beyond your personal efficiency right now you can't do it you don't have that level of uh efficiency yet you can grow into that over time but you have to allow that time to take place but if you get these one shot one kills where you're looking for a nice weekly trade of a 100 pit range you don't need the 100 pit range to pay you out handsomely but if you go in aiming for it once in a while you'll hit it and we'll just play devil's advocate for a moment and again we're going to assume for a moment you did you're able to take down 100 Pips a week it may require you to do another trade to pan out to get to that 100 Pips I'm not telling you to force yourself to get 100 Pips every week but it may require you to do a second trade or a third trade or you may take another trade and it reduces you down to just this you can lose you're going to have it you're going to have an uh encountered uh uh barriers like everyone else does in trading but if you're making your second portion of your trade pan out and you're reaching for higher time frame objectives like we just framed up this trade a low risk trade that's been framed on a higher time frame premise with the things that I taught you to focus on on the month of September's content the second portion of the trade will always make more than the first obviously you're getting out early with a portion but the partial is not a weakness it's not an impediment to you making more money when when when Traders or Educators or other folks say that you're taking off some of the trade before it gets to a a profit objective that you've had in mind beforehand that's coming from someone that does not make money consistently and I'm telling you because they're forcing themselves to hold on for their ultimate objective and their two black and white in profit taking you you have to pay yourself when it's available if you're binary It's All or Nothing you're never going to be as good as you think you are believe me I'm very proficient with price action but I don't demand everything all off at my profit objective my higher end profit objective I've learned to pay myself because as many times I've seen I've had really handsome uh profits sitting in a trade but I did not allow myself to take something off and I watched it come all the way back and turn into a loser or come back and take me out with a A minus stop loss and then run in my favorite which is very frustrating and you've probably encountered that yourself but let's say for instance you couldn't manage to do that trade with 10 Pips and you were just stuck to that one hour setup no problem no problem there's no reason to be upset about that if you allow that 20 pip setup to give you a 50 pip run okay think about this if you take the first portion of that trade off and you only get 50 more Pips Beyond in other words you've you've placed your trade on and you paid yourself a modest 30 Pips move to the sidelines and then you only managed to get another 50 Pips well you made over ten percent right there on the second portion of the trade think about that it's not about how many perfect exits and entries you get this is after your first profit you pay yourself something and then let the partial run the balance has to run and that will always pay you more and here's the thing the psychological effects of it not being uh a trade that's already paid you you've taken some skin off of it and that's good because you have one pound of Flesh now okay for your time your energy and your focus in that Marketplace when you focus on trading like that 10 in one month on the back end of your trade that's not just we've already factored in counting the first portion of your trade that goes without saying that that leads to 12 by itself but if you can't do this Ultra short-term trades you can still do trades like this and that's still handsome ten percent compounded over the year is over 300 percent for the for the year and that's amazing where else are you going to get 300 return there's no money manager out there going to raise his hand say I'll do that for you there's no fund manager is going to say hey look you know I'll double your money in a year and I can consistently do that I'm going to work hard to do that they're not working hard for your money okay they're doing very little they're very lazy and you're going to watch your money better than anybody else so when you see things like this it's real important you focus on that number is an astonishing number you can do very very well with tripling your money every single year 10 a month compounded does that
